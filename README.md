# Object-Detection
he project employs TensorFlow 2.0 for object detection model setup and OpenCV for real-time webcam-based detection. It integrates SSD ResNet101 V1 FPN 640x640 model architecture, allowing efficient detection. These technologies enable rapid deployment and experimentation with object detection tasks in a Python environment.
